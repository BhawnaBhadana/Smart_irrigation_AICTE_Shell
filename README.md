# Smart Irrigation System (AICTE Internship) ðŸŒ±

## Overview
An automated irrigation system built using IoT, designed to optimize water usage based on real-time soil moisture, temperature, and humidity data.

## Features
- Real-time sensor data collection (DHT11 for temp/humidity, Soil Moisture sensor).
- Threshold-based control of DPDT 12â€¯V relay and water pump.
- Logs sensor readings in CSV files with timestamps.
- Responsive web UI showing live data and pump status.
- Modular JS: clear separation of sensor reading, UI handling, and data logging.
- GitHub-hosted project for consistent version control.

## Technologies Used
- **Hardware:** ESP32 (or Arduino UNO), DHT11 sensor, Soil Moisture Moistor, 12â€¯V relay, submersible pump.
- **Software:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (frontend), CSV for logging, Git & GitHub.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BhawnaBhadana/Smart_irrigation_AICTE_Shell.git
