# 🌿 Smart Irrigation System – Week 1

A static web-based dashboard that visualizes sensor data and provides basic irrigation advice using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is the Week 1 milestone for the internship project.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Smart Irrigation System is designed to help farmers monitor soil and environmental conditions and decide when irrigation is needed. In this Week 1 version, we're using simulated data from a CSV file to:

- Display key sensor readings
- Show irrigation advice based on average moisture
- Lay the foundation for future integration with backend, ML, and real sensors

---

## 🔧 Features Implemented (Week 1)

✅ Static dashboard with sample sensor values  
✅ Irrigation advice logic using average sensor data  
✅ Clean and responsive UI design  
✅ Ready for CSV integration and future Flask/ML upgrades

## 📊 Dataset Used

The dataset (`sensor_data.csv`) contains:

- 20 sensor columns (`sensor_0` to `sensor_19`)
- 3 output columns (`parcel_0`, `parcel_1`, `parcel_2`) indicating irrigation zones
- 2000 total data entries (simulated)

Only the first few sensors are used for display in this version.
