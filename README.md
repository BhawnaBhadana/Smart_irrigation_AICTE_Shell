# 🌿 Smart Irrigation System – Week 1 Milestone

This is my Week 1 project submission for the **AICTE Shell Internship**. The project is a static web-based Smart Irrigation dashboard that uses sensor data from a CSV file to give basic irrigation suggestions.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Smart Irrigation System** helps monitor environmental conditions like soil moisture using sensor data. It aims to provide irrigation alerts based on real-time or historical data, promoting water efficiency and better crop health.

In Week 1, I've built the frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to simulate and visualize sensor readings.

## ✅ Week 1 Milestone - Improvisations Done

- Set up the complete **GitHub repository**
- Built a clean and responsive **HTML/CSS UI dashboard**
- Simulated sensor readings using sample data from a real CSV file
- Used **JavaScript logic** to calculate average moisture and show advice
- Created a proper folder structure for future backend/ML integration
- Uploaded the actual dataset (CSV with 2000 rows)

## 🗂️ Project Structure


---

## 🧪 Dataset Info

- `sensor_0` to `sensor_19` → 20 sensor readings (simulated)
- `parcel_0`, `parcel_1`, `parcel_2` → irrigation areas/zones
- 2000 rows of data used from uploaded CSV file

Only a few sensor values are shown in the frontend for Week 1 demo.

---

## 📊 Features Implemented

- Display simulated sensor values in a clean table
- Calculate average moisture from selected sensors
- Show irrigation advice like:
  - ✅ Moisture Sufficient
  - 💧 Moisture Low
  - 🚨 Very Dry Soil
